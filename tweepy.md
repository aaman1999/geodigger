Tweepy
======

Tweepy is one of a number of Python libraries that adds support for
using Twitter's APIs. It was chosen over other Twitter libraries
because, at the time of this writing, it is under active development and
has full support for all of Twitter's features, including authenticating
via OAuth and connecting to the streaming APIs. Unfortunately, tweepy is
not well documented, especially when it comes to the streaming APIs;
however, this lack of documentation is helped by the fact that the
tweepy developers used a very predictable, "Pythonic" style and closely
followed the spirit of the Twitter APIs. Once a developer understands
the basic rules governing tweepy usage, delving deeper into Twitter API
internals with this library becomes trivial.
